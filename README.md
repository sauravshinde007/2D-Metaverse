Welcome to the future of work. This platform isn't just a video calling tool; it's a persistent, spatial virtual office designed to bring the spontaneity and connection of physical spaces to remote teams. Move, interact, and collaborate naturally.

## Key Features

### Proximity-Based Video & Audio
Forget scheduling links. Just walk up to a colleague to start talking. Our spatial audio engine simulates real-world acoustics, allowing for natural hallway conversations and quick sync-ups. As you move away, the audio fades, just like in real life.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Security meets spatial design. Designated zones such as "CEO Office" or "Server Room" are restricted based on user roles. 
- **Admins** have full access and oversight.
- **Employees** access general work zones.
- **Guests** are limited to public lobbies.

### Line-of-Sight Audio Architecture
Privacy matters. Our advanced audio engine respects physical boundaries—walls block sound, enabling private meetings right next to busy common areas without interference.
